# .NET Core 6 Web API with Background Job powered by HangFire

This repository contains a sample .NET Core 6 Web API that demonstrates the integration of background job processing and SignalR for real-time communication.

## Features

- **Web API**: Built using .NET Core 6, this project provides a RESTful API for interacting with various resources.

- **Background Job Processing**: Background jobs are handled using a background job processing library. In this example, we use Hangfire.

- **Real-time Communication**: The project utilizes SignalR for real-time communication, allowing clients to receive updates instantly.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
